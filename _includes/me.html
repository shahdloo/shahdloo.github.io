	I am a researcher at Oxford Centre for Functional MR Imaging of the Brain <a href="https://www.win.ox.ac.uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">(FMRIB)</a>, University of Oxford, working with <a href="https://users.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/~mchiew/Home.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mark Chiew</a>.

<p>
	I had my undergraduate degree in Electrical Engineering from Amirkabir University, Tehran.
	After working as an embedded systems developer for a couple of years, I moved to Ankara where I did my graduate work in the lab of <a href="http://www.icon.bilkent.edu.tr" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tolga &#199;ukur</a>.</p>
<p>
	My research centers on developing methods to make MR imaging faster and more accurate.
	Recently, I am focused on reducing motion artifacts in functional MRI in awake non-human primates and in rodents.
	Also, I develop computational models to map representation of visual and auditory natural stimuli in the human brain.
