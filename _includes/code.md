Below are some examples of code I have written — see my GitHub profile for an exhaustive listing of [all my open source projects](https://github.com/oliviaguest?utf8=%E2%9C%93&tab=repositories&q=&type=source&language=0):

* [Gini coefficient](https://github.com/oliviaguest/gini) in Python. As used in [Guest and Love (2017)](http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.21397).

* [(Re)district states](https://github.com/oliviaguest/gini) in C and Python.
  This is a unified codebase that draws district boundaries and compares them to existing ones — see [Guest et al. (2019)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s42001-019-00053-9).
  It makes use of the following two libraries written by me:

  * [Weighted *k*-means](https://github.com/oliviaguest/weighted_k_means) in Python.
    This is an algorithm developed by [Guest et al. (2019)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s42001-019-00053-9) to redistrict US states.

  * [Pairwise weighted distances](https://github.com/oliviaguest/pdist) between points for very big datasets in C. This is useful as basis to run things on massive data, e.g., in Python with pandas, without running out of RAM.

* [Code for generating this website](https://github.com/oliviaguest/oliviaguest.github.io) and for [generating bradlove.org](https://github.com/lovebc/lovebc.github.io) in Jekyll, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — full front- and back-end by me, including layout design. These repositories include code for the automated listing of publications as seen above.

* [Estimate the functional dimensionality of (neural) data](https://github.com/lovelabUCL/dimensionality) in Python (original code in MATLAB), described in [Ahlheim and Love, B.C. (2018)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2018.06.015).
